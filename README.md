## What is the Machine Learning Life Cycle?

The machine learning life cycle is the cyclical process that data science projects follow. 
It defines each step that an organization should follow to take advantage of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to derive practical business value.

1: Business context and define a problem
2: Translating to AI problem and approach
3: Milestones and Planning
4: Data gathering and Understanding
5: Data preparation
6: Data Cleaning
7: Exploratory data analysis
8: Feature engineering and selection
9: ML Model assumption and checks
10: Data preparation for modelling
11: Model Building
12: Model Validation & Evaluation
13: Predictions & Model deployment

### 1. Define Project Objectives:
 The first step of the life cycle is to identify an opportunity to tangibly improve operations, increase customer satisfaction, or otherwise create value.

### 2. Acquire and Explore Data: 
 The next step is to collect and prepare all of the relevant data for use in machine learning. 

### 3.Model Data:
 In order to gain insights from your data with machine learning, you must determine your target variable, the factor on which you wish to gain deeper understanding.

### 4. Interpret and Communicate:
 One of the most difficult tasks of machine learning projects is explaining a model’s outcomes to those without any data science background.
 Traditionally, machine learning has been thought of as a “black box” because it is difficult to interpret insights and communicate the value of those insights to stakeholders and regulatory bodies.
 The more interpretable your model, the easier it will be to meet regulatory requirements and communicate its value to management and other key stakeholders.
