## What is the Machine Learning Life Cycle?

The machine learning life cycle is the cyclical process that data science projects follow. 
It defines each step that an organization should follow to take advantage of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to derive practical business value.

### 1. Define Project Objectives:
 The first step of the life cycle is to identify an opportunity to tangibly improve operations, increase customer satisfaction, or otherwise create value.

### 2. Acquire and Explore Data: 
 The next step is to collect and prepare all of the relevant data for use in machine learning. 

### 3.Model Data:
 In order to gain insights from your data with machine learning, you must determine your target variable, the factor on which you wish to gain deeper understanding.
